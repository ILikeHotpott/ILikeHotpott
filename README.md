## üåü Projects

### 1. Project1: [MusicTop](https://github.com/ILikeHotpott/MusicSite)

### Website: [![MusicTop](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MusicTop-FF7139?style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Chrome&logoColor=white&link=http://www.music-top.com)](http://www.music-top.com)

![My GIF](https://musictop-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/mygif.gif)

This is my music website project. What I want to do is to create a social platform based on music charts, allowing users to quickly find and escape the frustration of finding good songs. This is my first formal personal project, and I attach great importance to it. The initiation of this project combines my love for music, my passion for programming, and my past dreams of creating a secondary ticketing website. I want to build it into a comprehensive social website, launch it, and continue to operate it.


### 2. Project2: [Chatbot](https://github.com/ILikeHotpott/myChatbot)

This chatbot was developed specifically for my parents, as I wanted them to experience the convenience of modern technology. Due to the Great Firewall in China, they were unable to use ChatGPT directly. To overcome this limitation, I spent two days developing a simple chatbot using the ChatGPT API. The website is straightforward and provides basic chat functionality, allowing them to easily access and use it without any technical barriers.
